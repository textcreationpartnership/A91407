            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>That which I am to ſpeake is concerning the ill Councells; to this, I ſhall lay downe theſe Steppes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat the danger that comes to a <hi>State</hi> by <hi>ill Councells;</hi> That they are the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> moſt pernicious Dangers that can come to a State. It is uſuall to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>Politique Bodies</hi> with the <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall;</hi> the <hi>Naturall Body</hi> is endangered divers wayes; either by outward violence, and that may be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene and prevented; or by leſſe appearing Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which growes upon the Body by the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Ayre, immoderate Exerciſe, Diet, &amp;c. And when the cauſes of the Diſeaſe are cleare, the Remedie is eaſily applyed: But Diſeaſes which
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:157522:3"/> proceed fom the <hi>Inward Parts;</hi> as the Liver, the Heart, or the Braine, it is a hard thing to apply Cure to ſuch diſeaſes: <hi>Ill Councells</hi> they are of that nature, &amp;c. For the Miſchiefs that come by <hi>evill Councells</hi> corrupts the <hi>Vitall</hi> PARTS, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes the Adminiſtration of Publique Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Step, That there have beene lately and ſtill are <hi>ill Councells</hi> heere in this Kingdome and about the King. That there hath beene lately, you will not doubt, when the maine Courſe of Goverment hath beene ſo imployed, as Popery thereby hath beene ſo maintained, the Lawes ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and no diſtinction betweene Juſtice and injuſtice, and that there is ſtill reaſon to doubt is apparent by courſes taken to advance miſchievous Deſignes: but that His <hi>Majeſties</hi> wiſedome and Goodneſſe kept them from the Heart, though they were not kept out of the <hi>Court;</hi> ſo the principall and moſt miſchievous Deſignes have beene pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by ſuch as have neere Acceſſe unto His <hi>Majeſtie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Third ſteppe, that the ill Councells of this time are in their own natures more miſchievous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and more dangerous then the ill Councells of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, former Councells have been to pleaſe the King, and Prince, to raiſe up Prerogative; if it had gone no further, it had brought many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, but not to ruine and deſtruction: But the ill Councells of this time were to alter Religion and Law, therefore more miſchievous in their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:157522:3"/> owne nature then the ill Councells of former times.</p>
            <p>Fourth ſteppe, That theſe ill Councells have proceeded from a ſpirit and inclination to Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and have had a dependencie on Popery. The Religion of the Papiſts is a Religion incomputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to any other Religion, deſtructive to all others, and doth not indure any thing that doth oppoſe it; whoſoever doth withſtand their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, if they have power, they bring them to ruine. There are other Religions but not ſo deſtructive as Popery is, for the principles of Popery are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to all States, and perſons that oppoſe it: with the progreſſe of this miſchievous Councell, they provide Councellors that may execute their own deſignes, and to turn all Councells to their own ends. And you find that now in <hi>Ireland,</hi> That thoſe deſignes that have been upon all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he three Kingdomes doe end in a Warre, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> of Popery in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifth ſteppe, That unleſſe theſe ill Councells be changed, as long as they continue, it is impoſſible that any Aſſiſtance, Ayd, or Advice that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament can take to Reforme, wilbe effectuall for the Publique. Thoſe that are the inſtruments of State they put things into action, in good order, but if acted by evill men, while theſe Councells are on foot we can expect no good.</p>
            <p>The Sixth ſteppe, That this is the moſt proper time to deſire of his Majeſtie, the alteration and change of evill Councellors, becauſe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth is brought into diſtempers by them,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:157522:4"/> and ſo exhauſted, that we can endure no longer.</p>
            <p>Next reaſon why we cannot admit of them, is, to ſhew our love and fidelity to the King in great contributions and adventures: when <hi>God</hi> doth imploy his Servants, hee doth give ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to rowſe up their Spirits. This is the time wherin the Subjects are to ſave the Kingdome with the hazard of their Lives, and Fortunes; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expect from His Majeſty in a more large, and bountifull manner, then at other times. As we have weakneſſe at home, ſo we ought to diſcerne the Actions abroad, where great proviſion is made, and a careleſſeneſſe and improvidence herein; when our neighbours are ſo provided, and have ſuch great Fleets at Sea, will open a way to ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine ruine and deſtruction, before we can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared; and therfore now the fitteſt time to move the King.</p>
            <p>The laſt Steppe that this Alteration of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, will bring great advantage to the King in his own deſignes. In all our Actions our Prayers unto <hi>God</hi> ſhould be, that his Name ſhould be glorified; ſo our Petitions to His Majeſty, ſhould bring on our profit and advantage to him. 1. A diſcouragement to the Rebels, a great part of their confidence is in the evill Councels at home, as by the Examinations appeareth. 2. Advantage is great incouragement to the Kings good Subjects at home (who hazard their lives, and give Ayd and Contribution) to have things governed for the publique good. It will make men affraid to preferre Servants to the King, that are ill Councells, when they ſhall come
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:157522:4"/> to the examination of a Trienniall Parliament; for many times Servants are preferred to Princes for advantage of Forraigne eſtates.</p>
            <p>Next, this will put an Anſwer into the Kings mouth againſt all importunities, that he is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre none but ſuch as will be approved on by Parliament; thoſe that are Honourable, and moſt Ingenious are apteſt to be troubled in this kind, and not to deny: therfore the King may Anſwere he hath promiſed his Parliament not to admit of any but by advice in Parliament, this will anſwere them all.</p>
            <p>Next, advantage, it makes us fitter to enter into Union with Forraigne Nations, and Forraigne States; and to be made partaker of the ſtrength and aſſiſtance of others: It will fortifie us againſt the deſignes of Forraigne Princes. There hath bin cunning Councell at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in <hi>Spaine</hi> to reduce us to Popery; if good Councells at home, we ſhall be the better prepared to preſerve Peace and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and better reſpect from abroad.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, it will make us fit for any noble deſigne abroad.</p>
